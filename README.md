# clayscraper

I wanted a list of clay bodies that can be sorted/filtered by various characteristics. Laguna makes *a lot* of different clays, so I slapped together some functions to scrape the data into a spreadsheet.

Want the cleaned up spreadsheet of clays? [Here it is.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-OB2215MkYa8ahn4SySlFGC3SruQsl-Ac-zunVDWkUo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Issues: 

The description text is very inconsistent from clay to clay. Even though most of the output is cleaned up, there's still a lot of final tidying required in the resulting spreadsheet.

## Future Improvements: 

Other clay companies exist! Get that data too!
