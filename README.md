# clayscraper

I wanted a list of clay bodies that can be sorted/filtered by various characteristics. Laguna makes *a lot* of different clays, so I slapped together some functions to scrape the data into a spreadsheet.

Want the cleaned up spreadsheet of clays? [Here it is.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-OB2215MkYa8ahn4SySlFGC3SruQsl-Ac-zunVDWkUo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Issues: 

1. CSV doesn't preserve type, which causes problems with cone 06 vs 6. Should update this so that exports go to XLSX.
2. The description text is very inconsistent from clay to clay. Even though most of the output is cleaned up, there's still a lot of final tidying required in the resulting spreadsheet.

## Future Improvements: 

1. Other clay companies exist! Get that data too!
